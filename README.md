# pyprocgen

The pyprocgen project is an experiment in applying data structures and 
algorithms to procedural generation of interactive narrative content. This
repo is meant to hold python modules and scripts which explore various ways 
of approaching the challenge of narrative-focused content generation.


## Documentation

All documentation will exist as in-source python docstrings.


## Never production ready

This is not meant to be the best possible implementation. It may not ever
work well. It is just an experiment.


## Some possibilities
- Data analysis and visualization
- Generate plot outlines
- Generic interface for running tabletop games
- Very simple interactive story script


## Getting started

To use pyprocgen, simply (1) clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/FreeDelete-Software/pyprocgen.git
```

(2) change into the new pyprocgen directory:

```
cd pyprocgen
```

(3) clone the example data:

```
git clone https://github.com/FreeDelete-Software/corpora.git
```

(4) Write *and* run code inside the pyprocgen directory.
